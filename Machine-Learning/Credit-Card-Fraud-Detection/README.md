# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This is a credit card fraud detection project using Python's machine learning library, Scikit-Learn. The project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify emails into legit or fraud.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the creditcard.csv file as its dataset, comprising 284807 transactions with 31 columns. The Class column indicates whether the transaction is classified as legit or fraud.
