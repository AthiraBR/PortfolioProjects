# Fake News Prediction 
This is a fake news prediction project using Python's machine learning library, Scikit-Learn. The project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify news into Real or Fake.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the creditcard.csv file as its dataset, comprising 20800 transactions with 5 columns. The Label column indicates whether the news is classified as Real or Fake.

## Dependencies
* Pandas

* Scikit-Learn

* Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)

* Numpy (Imported but not used)

To execute this project, you can use Google Colab and import the dependencies mentioned above.

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this project is Logistic Regression, a classification algorithm designed for assigning observations to distinct set of classes. In this instance, the algorithm categorizes news  as either Real or Fake
