# Spam Mail Prediction

This is a spam mail prediction project using Python's machine learning library, Scikit-Learn. The project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify emails into spam or ham.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the mail_data.csv file as its dataset, comprising 5572 emails with two distinct columns: Category and Message. The Category column indicates whether an email is classified as spam or not, while the Message column contains the text of the email.

## Dependencies
Pandas          
Scikit-Learn      
Numpy (Imported but not used)      
To execute this project, you can use Google Colab and import the dependencies mentioned above.

## Algorithm
The algorithm used in this project is Logistic Regression, a classification algorithm designed for assigning observations to distinct set of classes. In this instance, the algorithm categorizes emails as either spam or non-spam, relying on the content of the email text.

## How to improve the project
* Try different machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Decision Tree
* Preprocess the data by stemming or lemmatizing the text
* Use different feature extraction techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or Word2Vec
