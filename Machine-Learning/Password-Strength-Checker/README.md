# Password Strength Checker
This is a password strength project using Python's machine learning library, Scikit-Learn. The project compares accuracy between Random Forest Classfication and Logistic Regression algorithm and also classify passwords into weak, medium or strong.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the data.csv file as its dataset, comprising 669640 passwords with 2 columns. The strength column indicates whether the password is classified as weak, medium or strong.
