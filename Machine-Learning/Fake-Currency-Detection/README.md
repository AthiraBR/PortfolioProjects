# Fake Currency Detection
This is a fake currency detection project using Python's machine learning library, Scikit-Learn. The project uses the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify currency into legit or fake.

## Dataset
This project utilizes the data_banknote_authentication.csv file as its dataset, comprising 1371 rows with 5 columns. The auth column indicates whether the transaction is classified as legit or fake.
