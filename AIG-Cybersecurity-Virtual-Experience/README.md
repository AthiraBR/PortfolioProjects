## AIG-Shields-up-Cybersecurity-Virtual-Experience

As an Information Security Analyst, analyze security alerts and respond to a ransomware attack using Python and stakeholder management skills

<b>Task One: Responding to a zero-day vulnerability</b>

  CISA has just released an alert on a new zero-day vulnerability for Apache Log4j. Research the vulnerability and publish an advisory to affected teams to alert and prevent exploitation.
  
  🐞 What you'll do :
  
  Draft an email to affected teams to alert them of the vulnerability, and explain how to remediate

<b>Task Two: (Technical) Bypassing ransomware</b>

  One of our servers has been exploited by the Log4j vulnerability, and the attacker just tried to load some ransomeware! Write a bruteforcer to break into the ransomware-encrypted files, so we don’t have to pay the ransom. 
  
  🐞 What you'll do :
  
  Write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file, to avoid paying a ransom
